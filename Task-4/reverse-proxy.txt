A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server, which is accessible from the public network. It can cache static data, use compressions and more. It's main purpose is to act like as a Load-Balancer in internal server networks, but they can play a crucial part in security too as a firewall. 
There are multiple types of reverse proxies (depending on the setup),like they can be the first line of defense against attacks (by firewall), they can hide the server's identity, can do basic HTTP access authentication and many more, but their main function is the optimalization/load balancing as I mentioned.
Nginx is one of the most used web server. It's reputation came from it's high performance, functionality (it's a HTTP/reverse proxy server and a mail proxy server too), use an evented IO model for fast IO workload bound handling, can be hot reloaded and it's a free open source software.
Traefik was created to provide a Load-Balancer for microservices and make easier the deployment of microservices. It supports a lot of backends(like Docker, Kubernetes etc.), provides an easier approach by providing automatic discovery of metrics and services.
In conclusion, their main vision differentiate despite their resemblance of each other. Nginx is more ideal for busier websites, because of the performance it can provide, but for a big microservice system Traefik could be more easier, because it's automatic discoveries and it's wide palette of supported backends.
